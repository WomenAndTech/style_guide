        <p>A fresh look for an important project. We’ve redesigned and relaunched Women&&Tech, let us tell you why...</p>
        
        <p>This little project launched in 2012, a time when gender equality conversations was just gaining momentum. When we founded Women&&Tech, it was to challenge the ideas of tech as a male-dominated field. We wanted to share stories of women working in tech in order to showcase the wealth of talent that resides in our industry. Women&&Tech became a passion project for our entire team. </p>
        
        <p>After the momentum of the first few months of publishing, we hit a few roadblocks. We sprinted, grounded to a halt, sprinted again to catch up and halted again. The project changed hands, team members and sponsors and unfortunately, it had become inconsistent and stale. </p>
        
        <p>Looking back, we can point to particular issues, mistakes we made, things we didn’t do, issues on the back burner that never got addressed. Our original architecture was built around the concept of complete customization. This meant each interview could be crafted, designed and molded to the individual interviewee. We wanted to really showcase these women as individuals with unique talents. We realized soon enough that customizing each interview design was too ambitious and more importantly, unnecessary. It was the stories people wanted to hear. The design was secondary to the stories we’re telling, the conversations we’re having, and the connections we’re making between women and within the industry as a whole.</p>
