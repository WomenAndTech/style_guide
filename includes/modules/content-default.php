    <h2>Letter to our Readers</h2>
    <p>This little project launched in 2012; a time when gender equality conversations were just gaining momentum. We founded Women && Tech to challenge the idea of tech as a male-dominated field. Our goal was to invite and interview 50 women we admire out for a coffee, talk to them about their work, their experiences and their awesomeness, and share these conversations with the world. By sharing these stories, we wanted to recognize the efforts of women in this industry and contribute to a community that elevates one another.</p>
