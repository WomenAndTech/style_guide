        <p class="intro">Biying Miao is the co-founder of <a href="/">Hot Pop Factory</a>, a 3D Printing and Digital Fabrication Design Studio. The self- proclaimed art-geek has worked on projects exhibited at the Royal Ontario Museum, the <a href="/">Textile Museum of Canada</a> and the Art Gallery of Ontario.</p>

      <dd class="interview-a wrapper-sm">
        <p>My family moved to Canada from Shanghai when I was in fourth grade, and I grew up in Toronto. I was a very creative child who loved drawing and making things with my hands. Coming from a Chinese family, I was encouraged to play music but gravitated toward freeform arts, so learning an instrument in the classical sense never became something that I honed. I actually wish that I had done that. My 3D printers sound like singing robots, so that’s the music I make now. I’m sure if I put the time in, I could remix it into a pretty sweet song.</p>
        <p>I was always a bit of an art and music geek so when it came time to choose a career path I leaned toward architecture because it was a mix of art, science, and technology; all things that are very much a part of who I am.</p>

      <dt class="interview-q wrapper-sm">How do you explain your work to people who have never seen a 3D printer before and what do your parents think of Hot Pop Factory?</dt>
      <dd class="interview-a wrapper-sm">
        <p>In order to teach people what do we began leading workshops. We encourage folks to come in, get their hands dirty with the technology, and see the printers in action.</p>
        <p>Because digital fabrication has the capacity to realize a wide variety of ideas, our projects tend to range a lot in size, application, and industry - from designers, to brands, to hardware startups. I tell my parents that I make things with robots. That’s kind of a whimsical way of describing the nitty-gritty, but they’re always intrigued.</p>
